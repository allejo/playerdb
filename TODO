-Reduce the plugin wait time so that the request gets processed faster when
  the server is idle.

-Handle server errors and timeouts for the web request.

-Ensure that the query response goes to an admin in case the request takes
  a while to process and the admin leaves and another player joins in the
  mean time. Currently it stores the player slot number and just responds
  to that player when the response comes back.
